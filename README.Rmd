## Load necessary libraries and look at the data


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Problem 1

Make a table that describes each plane. It should have a column for tailnum, another column for average arrival delay, and another for the year the plane was manufactured.

```{r}
f <- flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T)) %>%
  left_join(planes) %>%
  select(tailnum:year)
```

## Problem 2

Make a table where each row is a day of the year. The first column is the date. The 2:4 columns give the number of (scheduled) departures from EWR, LGA, and JFK.

```{r}
f1 <- flights %>%
  group_by(origin, month, day)%>%
  summarize(deps = n())%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=origin,
              values_from = deps)
```

```{r}
f2 <- flights%>%
 mutate(date = as.Date(time_hour))%>%
 group_by(origin, date)%>%
 summarize(deps=n())%>%
 pivot_wider(names_from = origin, 
             values_from = deps) 
```

## Problem 3

Make a table where each row is a day of the year. Each destination airport is a column. The elements (day x destination) give the number of flights to that destination. What should NAâ€™s be?

```{r}
f3 <- flights %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(time_hour))%>%
  group_by(date, dest)%>%
  summarize(deps = n())%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=dest,
              values_from = deps)
```
